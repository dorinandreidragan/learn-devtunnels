# Remote Tunnel to a Web Server

This document describes how to use [Microsoft Dev tunnels][dev-tunnels] to connect to a web server
running on a remote machine.

Imagine this scenario: you are working on a web application that is running on your local
machine, and you want to show it to a friend or a colleague. You can use this feature to share your
local web server with them.

In order to do that, you first need to have a Microsoft or a GitHub account. In this document, I am
using a Microsoft account.

Let's get started!

## Step 1 - Install devtunnel CLI

Run the following command to install the `devtunnel` CLI:

```bash
curl -sL https://aka.ms/DevTunnelCliInstall | bash
```

See [Install the DevTunnel CLI][install-devtunnel-cli] for more information.

## Step 2 - Start a web server on your local machine

In this example, I am using a simple web server that serves a static HTML page. You can use any web
server you want.

```bash
# Create a simple HTML page that says "Hello World"
echo "Hello World" > index.html

# Start a simple web server that serves the index.html file
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

## Step 3 - Create a devtunnel to the web server

- Login to your Microsoft account using device code authentication:

  ```bash
  devtunnel user login -d
  ```

- Create a temporary devtunnel to the web server on port 8080, and allow anonymous access:

  ```bash
  devtunnel host -p 8080 --allow-anonymous
  ```

## Step 4 - Access the web server from the browser

- Open your browser and navigate to the URL that was printed in the previous step.
- You should see the "Hello World" page.
