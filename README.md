# Learn about Dev tunnels

This repository contains my notes about how to work with [Microsoft Dev tunnels][dev-tunnels] and
[VSCode Remote Tunnels][vscode-remote-tunnels].

- [Development with Remote Tunnels](development-with-tunnels.md) page describes how to use the [VSCode Remote
  Tunnels][vscode-remote-tunnels] feature to connect from a local VSCode Desktop or VSCode online to
  a remote machine, WSL2 instance, or even a Docker container.

- [Remote Tunnel to a Web Server](tunnel-to-webserver.md) page describes how to use [Microsoft Dev
  tunnels][dev-tunnels] to connect to a web server running on a remote machine.
